## Introduction
- What is Python? 
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.
- Why Python? 
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) is widely used in various domains like web development, data analysis, machine learning, AI, automation, etc. It has a strong community and a rich ecosystem of libraries.
- Installing Python 
    - [Guide on how to install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on different operating systems.
- Python IDEs 
    - Introduction to various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code.

## Python Basics
- Variables and Types 
    - Understanding how to create variables and the different data types in Python.
- Basic Operators 
    - Introduction to arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical, and other operators in Python.
- String Formatting 
    - Learn how to format strings using different methods like the old style (% operator), the new style (.format), and f-strings.
- Basic String Operations 
    - Learn basic operations that can be performed on strings like slicing, concatenation, and common string methods.

## Data Structures
- Lists 
    - Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. They are similar to arrays but can contain items of different types.
- Tuples 
    - Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. They are similar to lists but cannot be changed once defined.
- Sets 
    - Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are used when the existence of an object in a collection is more important than the order or how many times it occurs.
- Dictionaries 
    - Dictionaries are key-value pairs which are unordered, mutable, and indexed. They are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

## Control Flow
- If statements 
    - Learn how to use if, else, and elif statements to control the flow of your program.
- While loops 
    - While loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as the condition is true.
- For loops 
    - For loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, set, dictionary, or string) or other iterable objects.

## Functions
- Defining a Function 
    - Learn how to define a function and call it in your program.
- Function Arguments 
    - Understand different types of function arguments - required, keyword, default, and arbitrary arguments.
- Lambda Functions 
    - Lambda function is a small anonymous function which can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

## Modules and Packages
- Importing Modules 
    - Learn how to import different modules in Python and use their functionalities.
- Exploring built-in Modules 
    - Python has several built-in modules. Learn how to use some of the most common ones.
- Packages 
    - Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”.

## Errors and Exception Handling
- Syntax Errors 
    - Syntax errors occur when Python can’t interpret our code, since we didn’t follow the correct syntax.
- Exceptions 
    - Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. These errors are called exceptions.
- Using try/except/else/finally 
    - Learn how to handle exceptions in Python using try, except, else, and finally blocks.

## File I/O
- Reading from a File 
    - Learn how to open a file and read its content in Python.
- Writing to a File 
    - Learn how to write to a file or append content to an existing file.
- File Management 
    - Learn how to rename, delete files, create directories, and more.

## Standard Library
- Overview of the Python Standard Library 
    - The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to write everything from scratch.
- Useful Modules in the Standard Library 
    - Learn about some of the most useful modules in the Python Standard Library like os, sys, math, datetime, json, and more.

## Conclusion
- Recap 
    - A brief recap of all the topics covered in the course.
- Next Steps 
    - Suggestions for what to learn next, like advanced Python concepts, Python frameworks like Django or Flask, data science libraries like pandas and numpy, etc.
- Resources for Further Learning 
    - A list of resources like books, tutorials, and documentation for further learning.
